# Master-Thesis---Region-Embeddings
This thesis is an implementation of the PyTre Python package through three different cases. This package provides a model that uses embeddings as a tool for categorical variables treatment. Its main purposes are first the dimensionality reduction that is achieved compared with other methods (e.g. dummy variables) and second the meaning that can give to these variables and the consequences that it generates, as semantic similarity measurements.

The three cases where this model will be used are 
- for giving meaning to Copenhagen areas regarding the travel purposes that people that go there have
- measure similarities between different zones of the city of Santiago de Chile depending on human visual perceptions 
- to extract the relationship between the mobility characteristics of a city and its C02 emissions and how this relationship helps in the prediction task
